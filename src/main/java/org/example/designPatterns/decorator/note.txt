The decorator pattern is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that allows behavior
to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the
behavior of other objects in the same class. The decorator pattern is used when we want to extend the
functionality of an object in a flexible way, without having to create new subclasses for every possible
combination of behavior.
