The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for
creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will
be created. It is used when there is a need to create objects of different types, but the
specific type of object needed may not be known until runtime.

The Factory Design Pattern consists of a factory method that is responsible for creating objects.
The factory method is usually defined in an abstract class or interface, which allows subclasses
to implement the factory method and create objects of different types.

The advantage of using the Factory Design Pattern is that it decouples the creation of objects
from their usage, which makes it easier to maintain and extend the code. It also allows for the
creation of objects without exposing the creation logic to the client code, which helps to keep the
code more modular and flexible.

Overall, the Factory Design Pattern is a powerful technique for creating objects in a flexible and
maintainable way, and is widely used in software development.
