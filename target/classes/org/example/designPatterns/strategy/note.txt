The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables the
encapsulation of a family of related algorithms and allows them to be interchanged
at runtime. In this pattern, different algorithms that perform the same task are defined
as separate classes or objects, and each algorithm can be selected and used at runtime
based on the context or condition.
